            <h3>Hi! My name is Ismarji and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. My interest in web development started back in 2011 when I decided to try learning Javascript on Codecademy.</h3>
            <h3>Fast-forward to today, I've had the privilege of getting sponsored by Walmart to attend Hackbright's full-stack software engineering program. My main focus these days is building accessible, inclusive products that are more front-end leaning.</h3>
            <h3>Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>Javascript (ES6+)</li>
                <li>React</li>
                <li>Java</li>
                <li>Flask</li>
            </ul>
